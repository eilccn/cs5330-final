# CS5330 Final Project

## Deep Learning CNN for Fashion MNIST Clothing Classification

### Team Members: Eileen Chang, Karthik Komati, Prateep Rao Malyala, Srikanth Bonkuri

### Project Description

Fashion-MNIST is a new standard dataset of clothing article images and consists of a training set of 60,000 28x28 grayscale images and a test set of 10,000 images. Ten types of clothing, such as t-shirts, shoes, and dresses are mapped to 0-9 integers. The Fashion MNIST dataset was developed as a replacement for the MNIST dataset and it is proposed to be a more challenging classification problem in which the best results are achieved by deep learning convolutional neural networks.

For our teamâ€™s project, we aim to conduct a significant continuation of the deep network recognition techniques implemented in Project 5, and use this dataset as the basis for developing, evaluating, and using deep convolutional neural networks for classifying clothing articles from scratch. Since this dataset is more complex than the MNIST digit recognition data set used in Project 5, we can explore more in-depth the process of training deep networks. As an additional potential goal point, we may opt to include 2D object recognition elements implemented in Project 3 and use our trained deep network system to attempt to recognize random articles of clothing in real-time.
