### Project Description

Fashion-MNIST is a new standard dataset of clothing article images and consists of a training set of 60,000 28x28 grayscale images and a test set of 10,000 images. Ten types of clothing, such as t-shirts, shoes, and dresses are mapped to 0-9 integers. The Fashion MNIST dataset was developed as a replacement for the MNIST dataset and it is proposed to be a more challenging classification problem in which the best results are achieved by deep learning convolutional neural networks.
 
For our teamâ€™s project, we aim to conduct a continuation of the deep network recognition techniques implemented in Project 5, and use this dataset as the basis for developing, evaluating, and using deep convolutional neural networks for classifying clothing articles from scratch. Since this dataset is more complex than the MNIST digit recognition data set used in Project 5, we can explore more in-depth the process of training deep networks. We will also integrate 2D object recognition functionalities implemented in Project 3, and use our trained deep network system to recognize random articles of clothing in real-time. Additional features include autoencoders that will reduce noise in the set of input images--by passing noisy images through autoencoders, we will be able to work with cleaner image data, and therefore improve classification predictions. Lastly, we will include a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to interact with our program through GUI objects like icons and buttons.
