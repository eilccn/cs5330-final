### Project Description

Image classification, which seeks to identify categories of objects or scenes in images, is a supervised machine learning problem that has a variety of applications within the field of computer vision. Fashion classification, in particular, aims to identify categories of clothing items, and this appeals to emerging applications, such as e-commerce, computer-aided fashion design, social media, and video surveillance. In this project, the Fashion MNIST and DeepFashion data sets are used as the basis for training and developing deep convolutional neural networks for fashion clothing classification. The trained deep networks are then used to implement a real-time clothing recognition system. We also included a separate graphical user interface (GUI) that is trained on the Fashion MNIST dataset and allows users to upload images of clothing items and have them passed through the trained deep network for classification.
